Whether it's my code, this website, or myself, I love solutions that not only get the job done, but look good while doing it. I've worked with tons of front-end web frameworks such as Angular and React, and have lots of experience in the depths of object-oriented programming. I'm currently pursuing a BSE in computer science at the University of Michigan, all while doing a bit of web development on the side. When I'm not finding where I left out the semicolon, I'm playing in the Michigan Marching Band, ricing my Linux setups, or playing the Pokemon TCG.
